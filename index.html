    <h2>Under the Hood</h2>
    <p>rumm is built on the <a href="http://github.com/cowboyd/mvcli">MVCLI framework</a>. Much like Ruby on Rails was extracted from the development of Basecamp, MVCLI was extracted from the development of rumm. MVCLI can be thought of as "Rails for command line tools", and consists of a MVC-like Ruby framework that Rails developers will find familiar.</p>

    <p>The heavy lifting of the Rackspace OpenStack API is handled by <a href="http://fog.io">fog</a>.</p>

    <h2>Plugins</h2>
    <p>But wait, there's more! MVCLI was built from the ground up to allow for plugin development. Much like a Rails Engine, an MVCLI plugin is a gem that has its own models, views and controllers that can be used to extend the functionality of any MVCLI application, including rumm.
